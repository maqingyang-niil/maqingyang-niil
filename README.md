Hi I am a sophomore at Beijing University of Chemical Technology.
I major in automation while I still not very clear about my major, maybe it focuses on software, hardware and control system. What I would like to do or maybe precisely could do in future is still a mystery.
I update ramdomly about my learning footprint on data structure/embedded programming/cpp, I am actually a stranger to the computering or coding but learning it could be a good way to kill time or improve myself.
I do hope to hear any suggestion from every possible viewer on my codes, English grammers and any other mistakes.
