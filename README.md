Hi I am a sophomore at Beijing University of Chemical Technology.
I major in automation while I still not very clear about my major, maybe it focuses on software, hardware and control system. What I would like to do or maybe precisely could do in future is still a mystery.
I update ramdomly about my learning footprint on data struct, I am actually stranger to the computering or coding but learning it could be a good way to kill time or inprove myself.
I do hope to hear any suggestion from every viewer.
